# Financial Models (Project Skill)

## Description
Advanced financial modeling suite with DCF analysis, sensitivity testing, Monte Carlo simulations, and scenario planning for investment decisions. Project-level instance of the financial modeling skill.

## Trigger
When asked to build financial models, DCF analysis, sensitivity testing, Monte Carlo simulations, or scenario planning within a project context.

## Instructions

# Financial Modeling Suite

A comprehensive financial modeling toolkit for investment analysis, valuation, and risk assessment using industry-standard methodologies.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
- Build complete DCF models with multiple growth scenarios
- Calculate terminal values using perpetuity growth and exit multiple methods
- Determine weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
- Generate enterprise and equity valuations

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis
- Test key assumptions impact on valuation
- Create data tables for multiple variables
- Generate tornado charts for sensitivity ranking
- Identify critical value drivers

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation
- Run thousands of scenarios with probability distributions
- Model uncertainty in key inputs
- Generate confidence intervals for valuations
- Calculate probability of achieving targets

### 4. Scenario Planning
- Build best/base/worst case scenarios
- Model different economic environments
- Test strategic alternatives
- Compare outcome probabilities

## Model Types Supported

1. **Corporate Valuation** - Mature, growth, turnaround
2. **Project Finance** - Infrastructure, real estate, energy
3. **M&A Analysis** - Acquisition valuations, synergy modeling, accretion/dilution
4. **LBO Models** - Leveraged buyout, returns analysis (IRR, MOIC), debt capacity

## Best Practices

- Use multiple valuation methods for triangulation
- Apply appropriate risk adjustments
- Consider market comparables
- Validate against trading multiples
- Document key assumptions clearly
- Identify and quantify key risks
- Stress test extreme cases

## Quality Checks

1. Balance sheet balancing checks
2. Cash flow reconciliation
3. Circular reference resolution
4. Sensitivity bound checking
5. Statistical validation of Monte Carlo results
