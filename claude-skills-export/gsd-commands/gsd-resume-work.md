### Objective
Restore complete project context and resume work seamlessly from previous session.

Routes to the resume-project workflow which handles:
- STATE.md loading (or reconstruction if missing)
- Checkpoint detection (.continue-here files)
- Incomplete work detection (PLAN without SUMMARY)
- Status presentation
- Context-aware next action routing

### Execution Context
Loads workflow from `workflows/resume-project.md`.

### Process
**Follow the resume-project workflow**.

The workflow handles all resumption logic including:
1. Project existence verification
2. STATE.md loading or reconstruction
3. Checkpoint and incomplete work detection
4. Visual status presentation
5. Context-aware option offering (checks CONTEXT.md before suggesting plan vs discuss)
6. Routing to appropriate next command
7. Session continuity updates
