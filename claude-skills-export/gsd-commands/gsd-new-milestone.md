# GSD: New Milestone

## Description
Start a new milestone cycle: questioning -> research (optional) -> requirements -> roadmap. Brownfield equivalent of new-project. Project exists, PROJECT.md has history. Gathers "what's next", updates PROJECT.md, then runs requirements -> roadmap cycle.

## Trigger
`/gsd:new-milestone [milestone name, e.g., 'v1.1 Notifications']`

## Instructions

```
name: gsd:new-milestone
description: Start a new milestone cycle -- update PROJECT.md and route to requirements
argument-hint: "[milestone name, e.g., 'v1.1 Notifications']"
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash, Task, AskUserQuestion
```

### Objective
Start a new milestone: questioning -> research (optional) -> requirements -> roadmap.

Brownfield equivalent of new-project. Project exists, PROJECT.md has history. Gathers "what's next", updates PROJECT.md, then runs requirements -> roadmap cycle.

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` -- updated with new milestone goals
- `.planning/research/` -- domain research (optional, NEW features only)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` -- scoped requirements for this milestone
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` -- phase structure (continues numbering)
- `.planning/STATE.md` -- reset for new milestone

**After:** `/gsd:plan-phase [N]` to start execution.

### Execution Context
Loads:
- `workflows/new-milestone.md`
- `references/questioning.md`
- `references/ui-brand.md`
- `templates/project.md`
- `templates/requirements.md`

### Context
Milestone name: $ARGUMENTS (optional - will prompt if not provided)

Project and milestone context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init new-milestone`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks where subagents are used.

### Process
Execute the new-milestone workflow end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, questioning, research, requirements, roadmap approval, commits).
